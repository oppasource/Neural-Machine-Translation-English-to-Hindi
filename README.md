# Neural-Machine-Translation-English-to-Hindi

Repo contains code to train different kinds of Neural Machine Translation Models. Translation is done from English to Hindi to see the models in action.

- `data/` folder contains the code used to train the models. The data is of small size as the main goal of the project was to explore different models to later scale them on larger datasets.

- `trained_models/` folder will contains the trained models once the training is done.

- `output/` folder contains the outputs that was given by all the different models.
